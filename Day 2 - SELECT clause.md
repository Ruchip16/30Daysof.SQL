# SELECT Query

- Select is the most commonly used statement in SQL. 
- It is used to retrieve or fetch data from a database. 
- We can fetch either the entire table or according to some specified rules. The data returned is stored in a result table. This result table is also called result-set.

### Basic Syntax:

```sh
SELECT column1, column2 FROM name_of_table;
```
**column1 , column2:**  names of the fields of the table

**name_of_table:**  from where we want to fetch


### Syntax to fetch the entire table: 

```sh
SELECT * FROM name_of_table;
```
